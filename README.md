Estimating cancer mortality for various time horizons.

This is dedicated to my mum, Mdm Seah Ah Chu, who passed away on March 15, 2025, due to cancer.

One of the things that was really difficult for me personally was never having a grasp of the time left, and I hope you'll never have to go through this. But if you do, hopefully some version of this will be helpful.
